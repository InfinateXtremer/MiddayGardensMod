#Level hack for Midday Gardens from Spyro Reignited Trilogy.
---
Source files are provided for the Mod the Dragon community to understand how "level hacks" are created.
Explanation:
* We replicated all the object names found in the level and placed them in their corresponding level files. And we also imported mesh for us to be able to see the level itself.
* We use LS310_Music as an 'injector' to run our own code and modify the level.
* In the packing process, LS310_Music is the only level file that gets added to the pak. Everything else acts as a dummy for us to be able to reference and interact with them.



IMPORTANT: If you get errors related to AkAudio, you need WWise 2018.1.11.6987.1381 integrated with the project
